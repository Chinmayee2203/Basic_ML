# Basic_ML projects

First is for analysing sentiments of covid-19 tweets in a given a given period of time. The dataset used here can be found from - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielpreda/covid-19-tweets/master/covid19_tweets.csv
The other project is about classication of traffic signs using Cnn and keras. The datasets are test.p, train.p, valid.p
The datasets are compressed using bz2 and hence need to be decompressed before using in the model.
